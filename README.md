#  🚗 Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)- Vehicle Insurance Project
## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of a vehicle insurance dataset. The goal is to identify patterns and factors influencing insurance claims, helping insurance companies make informed business and underwriting decisions.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Load and inspect the dataset.
- Clean and preprocess the data.
- Encoding Categorical Variables.
- Basic Statistics and Outlier Detection.
- Explore data distribution, patterns, and relationships.
- Visualize key insights using Python libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.

## 📊 Dataset Overview

The dataset contains detailed information about insured individuals, their demographics, vehicle information, policy types, and claim history. Key features include:

- 👤`Age`
- 🚻`Gender`
- 📍`Region_Code`
- 🚘`Vehicle_Age`
- 💥`Vehicle_Damage`
- 💰`Annual_Premium`
- 🏢`Policy_Sales_Channel`
- ⏳`Vintage`
- ✅`Response` (Target: 0 = No Claim, 1 = Claimed)

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- 🐍 Python  
- 📘 Pandas, NumPy  
- 📊 Seaborn, Matplotlib  
- 🔢 Scikit-learn (for encoding and transformation)  
- 💻 Google Colab

## 🔍 Key Highlights & Insights

✅ **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
- Handled missing values and corrected data types  
- Label encoding of categorical variables   

💡 **Key Insights**  
- Most claims are associated with damaged vehicles  
- Customers aged 20–40 are the highest insurance buyers  
- Higher annual premiums don't necessarily lead to more claims  
- Policy Sales Channel `26` dominates the distribution  
- 99.7% of customers possess a driving license
- Average annual premium is ₹30,507

## 📌 Areas for Improvement

- 🧠 Feature Engineering: Derive new metrics (e.g., premium-to-vintage ratio, age bins)
- 📉 Predictive Modeling: Incorporate classification models like Logistic Regression or Random Forest
- 🖥️ Dashboard: Build an interactive dashboard with Streamlit or Plotly Dash for real-time data insights
